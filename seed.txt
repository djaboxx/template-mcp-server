To implement an MCP (Model Control Protocol) server running in a Docker container on VS Code using the official MCP server library in Python, you can follow these general steps:

Set Up Your Python Environment:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the official MCP server library using pip (e.g., pip install mcp-server).

Dockerize the MCP Server:

Create a Dockerfile in your project directory to define how the Docker container should be built.

In the Dockerfile, use a Python base image and copy your project files into the container.

Install dependencies inside the Docker container.

Set the command to run your MCP server.

Configure VS Code:

Install the Docker extension for VS Code if you haven’t already.

Open your project folder in VS Code.

Use the VS Code terminal to build and run your Docker container.

Develop and Test:

Write your Python code to interact with the MCP server.

Test your implementation within the Docker container.

“Yeah, so tell me about the Python library, like how does that work? I saw that there are some decorators that I had to use for tools.”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Sure! The official MCP server library in Python typically allows you to create and manage tools using decorators. Here's a basic overview:

Import the MCP Server Library: Start by importing the MCP server library in your Python script.

Define Tools with Decorators: Use decorators provided by the library to define tools. Decorators are a way to modify or enhance functions or methods. For example, a decorator might register a function as a tool that can be called remotely.

Implement the Tool Logic: Inside the function decorated as a tool, write the logic that you want to execute when the tool is called.

Run the MCP Server: Start the MCP server to listen for incoming tool requests.

Here’s a simplified example to illustrate:

python
Copy
Edit
from mcp_server import MCPServer, tool

# Define a tool using a decorator
@tool
def my_tool_function(params):
    # Implement the logic for your tool here
    return "Tool executed with params: {}".format(

ChatGPT said:
To run your MCP server successfully in a Docker container, you'll need to set up your Dockerfile correctly. Here's a basic configuration you can follow:

Create a Dockerfile: In the root of your project, create a file named Dockerfile (without any extension).

Set Up the Dockerfile: Here's






You said:
“Would it make sense to set this up as a template repo? Because I feel like I'm probably gonna be making a lot more MCP servers, and I'm probably always gonna use the Python library. So what should I include in a template repo? And what should I have the user fill in in the repo after they've used the template repo?”

Setting up a template repository is a great idea for consistency and efficiency! Here's what you might include in your template repo:

Included in the Template Repo:
Dockerfile: A pre-configured Dockerfile that sets up the environment for your MCP server. It should include:

A Python base image.

Copying project files into the container.

Installing dependencies (e.g., using pip).

Running the MCP server.

Basic Python Script: A simple Python script that demonstrates how to define tools using decorators.

README File: Instructions on how to use the template, including how to build and run the Docker container, and how to add new tools.

Example Tool: An example tool function to show how to use the decorator and implement logic.

User to Fill In:
Project-Specific Code: Any specific tools or logic that the user wants to implement in their MCP server.

Configuration: Any environment-specific settings or configurations that need to be adjusted

“So what's the best option for a Docker Container Registry for free images?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
For free Docker container registries, you have several good options. Here are some popular choices:

Docker Hub: This is the most widely used registry and offers free hosting for public images. You can also have private repositories with some limitations.

GitHub Container Registry: Integrated with GitHub,






You said:
“What kind of GitHub actions can I have in my template repo that can already be set up to help facilitate the building and the deployment of Docker-based MCP service?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
You can set up several GitHub Actions in your template repo to facilitate building and deploying Docker-based MCP servers. Here are some useful GitHub Actions to consider:

Build and Push Docker Image: An action that automatically builds your Docker image and pushes it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs
